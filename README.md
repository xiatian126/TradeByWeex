# Quick Start

ValueCell is a Python-based application featuring a comprehensive web interface. Follow this guide to set up and run the application efficiently.

## Prerequisites

For optimal performance and streamlined development, we recommend installing the following tools:

**[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)** - Ultra-fast Python package and project manager built in Rust  
**[bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun#install)** - High-performance JavaScript/TypeScript toolkit with runtime, bundler, test runner, and package manager

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ValueCell-ai/valuecell.git
   cd valuecell
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit the `.env` file with your API keys and preferences. This configuration file is shared across all agents. See [Configuration Guide](docs/CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md) for details.

## Configuration

More detailed configuration information can be found at [CONFIGURATION_GUIDE](./docs/CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md)

### Model Providers
Configure your preferred model providers by editing the `.env` file:

- **Simple Setup**: Just configure the model provider's API Key

- **Advanced Configuration**: For research-type agents, you need to configure more environment variables. Please refer to the `.env.example` file for details.

- **Official Recommendation**: Configure OpenRouter + any supplier that provides embedding models. Reason: This enables quick model switching across providers and provides RAG+Memory AI capabilities
  

Choose your preferred models and providers based on your requirements and preferences.

## Running the Application

Launch the complete application (frontend, backend, and agents):

### Linux / Macos
```bash
bash start.sh
```

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
.\start.ps1
```

## Accessing the Interface

- **Web UI**: Navigate to [http://localhost:1420](http://localhost:1420) in your browser
- **Logs**: Monitor application logs at `logs/{timestamp}/*.log` for detailed runtime information of backend services and individual agents


## Next Steps

Once the application is running, you can explore the web interface to interact with ValueCell's features and capabilities.

## Live Trading

- Configure AI Models: Add your AI Model API Key through the web interface.
- Configure Exchanges: Set up Binance/HyperLiquid/OKX/Coinbase... API credentials
- Create Strategies: Combine AI model with exchange to create custom strategies
- Monitor & Control: Start/stop traders and monitor performance in real-time

### Supported Exchanges

| Exchange | Notes | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Binance** | Only supports international site [binance.com](binance.com), not US site. Uses USDT-M futures (USDT-margined contracts). Ensure your futures account has sufficient USDT balance. Trading pair format: `BTC/USDT` | ✅ Tested |
| **Hyperliquid** | Only supports USDC as margin currency. Uses your main wallet address + API wallet private key authentication (use [API tab](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/API) to apply). Market orders are automatically converted to IoC limit orders. Trading pair format must be manually adjusted to `SYMBOL/USDC` (e.g., `WIF/USDC`) | ✅ Tested |
| **OKX** | Requires API Key, Secret, and Passphrase for authentication. Supports USDT-margined contracts. Trading pair format: `BTC/USDT` | ✅ Tested |
| Coinbase | Supports USDT-margined contracts. Coinbase International is not yet supported | 🟡 Partially Tested |
| Gate.io | Supports USDT-margined contracts. Requires API Key and Secret | 🟡 Partially Tested |
| MEXC | Supports USDT-margined contracts. Requires API Key and Secret | 🟡 Partially Tested |
| Blockchain | Supports USDT-margined contracts. Requires API Key, Secret | 🟡 Partially Tested |

**Legend**:
- ✅ **Tested**: Fully tested and verified in production environment
- 🟡 **Partially Tested**: Code implementation complete but not fully tested, may require debugging
- **Recommended**: Prioritize using fully tested exchanges (Binance, Hyperliquid, OKX)

### Notice
- Currently supports leverage trading only, so you need to ensure your Perps account has sufficient balance.
- You must keep your API secrets secure to avoid losing funds. The app stores secrets locally on your device and will not send them to any third party over the internet.
- To ensure your account safety, you need to reset your API keys regularly. 

---
**Note**: Before running the application, ensure all prerequisites are installed and environment variables are properly configured. If it has been a long time since the last update, you can delete the database files in the project directories: `lancedb/`, `valuecell.db`, `.knowledgebase/` and start fresh
